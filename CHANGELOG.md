- Added `doc/audit/tools/nethermind-audit-agent/audit_agent_report_v0.1.0-feedback.md` with finding-by-finding feedback for the Nethermind Audit Agent report.

### Changed
- Bumped engine version string from `0.1.0` to `0.2.0`.
- Documented intentional post-initialization engine linking flow (Finding 1 acknowledged as valid by design).
- Emit `FixDescriptorEngineSet` when engine is set via `__fixDescriptorEngineModuleInitUnchained(...)` to improve indexer/audit-trail completeness.
- Replaced `this.token()` with immutable `TOKEN` in engine authorization hooks to remove unnecessary external self-calls.

### Added
- Initial release of CMTAT-FIX: on-chain FIX descriptor support for CMTAT tokens.
